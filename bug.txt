Sometimes API calls are getting called multiple times even after sleep. --Fixed?
Change List to set within CollectData because there are duplicate unique identifiers. Maybe riot games issue? -- Fixed.



Riot API Key allows for 100 req every 2 minutes. --> Have multiple keys.

Notice that when JSON dumps, it stringifies everything so keys are converted from int to strings.

Use Redis, S3 Buckets, SQL instead of JSON. Use JSONL to store things, best for large dataset.

When training, do reverse order to train also. Improves generialization.
