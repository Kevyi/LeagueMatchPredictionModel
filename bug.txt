Sometimes API calls are getting called multiple times even after sleep. --Fixed?
Change List to set within CollectData because there are duplicate unique identifiers. Maybe riot games issue? -- Fixed.



Riot API Key allows for 100 req every 2 minutes. --> Have multiple keys.

Notice that when JSON dumps, it stringifies everything so keys are converted from int to strings.

Use Redis, S3 Buckets, SQL instead of JSON.
